Getting this website up and running certainly took quite a bit longer than I had hoped. However, after a little over a year of rewriting and hosting migrations, we're finally here!

I have never particularly enjoyed writing. There's a reason that I went into an *Engineering* field. However, I hope that by writing on a regular(-ish) basis I will improve my ability to express my thoughts and ideas. And who knows, maybe someone out there will gain something along the way.

## Who am I?

Not a robot. You can learn a bit more about me over at [https://avojak.com](https://avojak.com).

## What do I have to share?

Hopefully a lot! I believe that the failure to share ideas and experiences with others is a terrible waste. Everyone has something to share whether they realize it or not.

I plan to share about technologies and techniques that I have learned about primarily during development of side projects. This will also be a place for me to post about those projects. I hope to go in depth(-ish) on how everything was built (both hardware and software), show off some pictures, and do some "lessons learned" and retrospectives along the way.
