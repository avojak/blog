Yesterday I received the little push notification from Stripe that a generous user had paid for one of my apps,
which are all now and forever free and open-source.
When I logged-in to my account I noticed that the payment put me at the $100 mark for gross volume. This was
certainly a nice little confidence boost, since nobody is ever forced to pay a tip/donation,
but it got me thinking a bit more deeply about why exactly I publish all of my apps as free or pay-what-you-want.

## Not About the Money

I'm going to get this out of the way first - but it's never been about making money. If it was, I wouldn't be
so excited about $100. I've been very fortunate to have a stable job that has afforded me the work-life balance
to be able to develop open-source apps in my spare time.

It's definitely a confidence boost when someone feels that one of my apps is worth spending their hard-earned
money on, but it's not my goal.

## I Benefit

This one falls into a few categories. Perhaps the very first reason I started writing open-source software was for my own memory.
I used to work on a large Java project that used Eclipse SWT for the UI and I wanted to make sure
that I had something to look back on to jog my memory for how things worked. This was the basis
for the Hydrogen plugin that I wrote for the Eclipse IDE.

{% include github-card.html
  user="avojak"
  repository="hydrogen"
%}

I also benefit from knowing that my work is out in the open, and (most of the time) I don't want to feel embarrassed by my code! 
Quick caveat here - nobody should *ever* be embarrassed by the quality of their code. There's always room for improvement, 
and you can't improve if you don't start. That said, sometimes the feeling is still inevitable! For me, I try to publish
code that I'm proud of (although it's still just "side project" quality, not up to the same standards as if I were writing it
for a job).

Another side of the "self benefit" is that I benefit from the suggestions that others make. When I publish my work on GitHub
I've had people open issues with fantastic suggestions for new features. Similarly I've had people find issues
that severely affect users and they will even open a pull request with a fix!

## Others Benefit

Early on I realized just how much I relied on the work that *other* people had done in the open. Not much more to say here,
chances are someone else may stumble across what I've written and it will help them figure out something that they're stuck
on.

## Why Not?

There are certainly reasons why people don't publish their work in the open, and that's perfectly fine.
But for me, given everything I've just described, and the absence of *any* reason not to, why not??
