This write-up is a bit delayed, but after two years of on-and-off development, Iridium is finally available!

The original goal for this project was twofold: 

1. Learn Vala in a practical way
2. Contribute to the elementary OS community

At some point I will write shorter, detailed posts about various aspects of the development and the challenges I ran into, but for now I'll stay at a high level.

## Design

### Connection Management

Each connection to a server is handled by a separate thread, with a `ServerConnectionManager` object to direct requests to the appropriate connection and send signals from the connections.

### Data Persistence

Connection information is stored in a SQLite database so that connections can be automatically re-created when the application launches. All credentials are stored using libsecret.

### Connection Visibility

The main design goal was to be intuitive. As such, the application is very much "what you see is what you get". Connected IRC servers are visible in a list on the left side of the screen. You can also disconnect from the server but leave it in the list to rejoin later.

When you join a channel, it will appear in the list nested beneath the associated server. Channels can also be saved as a favorite, which will bump them to a pinned section at the very top of the list, making it easier to access them.

## Challenges

### Testing

It's a good idea to do most of the testing against an IRC server that I own so as not to spam connection attempts. I relied heavily on the [InspIRCd containerized server](https://hub.docker.com/r/inspircd/inspircd-docker/) for my testing. This allowed my to quickly tweak server settings to test authentication, but most importantly un-ban myself for too many connection attempts!

### Storing Secrets

One unusual problem that I ran into was storing and retrieving secrets. For some reason I was unable to retrieve a secret without first storing one. On startup, the application attempts to pull any connection secrets using libsecret and *should* pop the dialog to unlock the keyring, but the user wasn't being prompted! The current workaround is to store a "dummy" secret on startup (only if there is something to retrieve - we don't want to unnecessarily interact with the keyring), which will always prompt the user. Subsequent requests are then successful.

## Resources

Several applications were invaluable during development:

- [quickDocs](https://appcenter.elementary.io/com.github.mdh34.quickdocs/) - Vala documentation
- [LookBook](https://appcenter.elementary.io/com.github.danrabbit.lookbook/) - Discovering available icon and image resources
- [Sequeler](https://appcenter.elementary.io/com.github.alecaddd.sequeler/) - Browsing the SQLite database and UI inspiration

The one page that I kept open most often while getting familiar with the Vala programming language was [Vala for Java Programmers](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Vala/ValaForJavaProgrammers).

Finally, the elementary OS documentation for developers is fantastic. The team has done a great job digesting design goals and guidelines in a very accessible way.
