Alright, I'm not one to go around promoting random things, but I've been buying coffee beans from the same
roaster for a couple years now and I don't think I'll ever buy any other beans to use on a daily basis.

Right off the bat I should add that I absolutely enjoy trying new coffee, and you should support your local roasters,
coffee shops, etc.
But for my daily brews, I'll be using Denver-based <b>[Sweet Bloom Coffee Roasters](https://sweetbloomcoffee.com)</b> beans for the foreseeable future.

I've never had coffee with this much _real_ flavor. I can't put my finger on what it is with most other coffee that I've made, but it usually all
ends up tasting the same, and not in a good way. 

I tend to pick up beans from Guatemala or Colombia. The tasting notes are usually lighter, more floral, and sometimes fruity. That said, I've never had a bag of beans from them that I didn't like, just ones that I've enjoyed more. If in doubt, the Hometown blend is a solid choice.
